# Project state / working notes

Living scratchpad of design decisions and known gaps. Read alongside [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## tC4 / Scripture Burrito interop — `src/lib/tc4.js`, `src/lib/journal.js`

**Status: working and round-trip tested (41 checks, `npm run test:tc4`, in CI). Implements
BURRITO-SPEC 1.1-draft from the tC4-pankosmia package; the reference sample project is vendored
at `test/fixtures/sample-burrito/` with Pankosmia's SB schema bundle beside it.**

Design decisions (the load-bearing ones):

- **Decisions merge by the spec's §5.2 identity key** — `(checkId, bookId, chapter, verse,
  occurrence)`, chapter/verse compared as **strings** so span verses (`"9-10"`) never collapse
  under `Number()`. `quoteString` is a verification field, not part of the key.
- **quoteString drift on a touched record re-anchors it** to the current resource (fresh
  contextId from the current check + the user's decision fields). The spec's "treat as
  unmatched" wording is a writer's trap: appending duplicates the identity key, skipping loses
  the user's work. Flagged as spec feedback; untouched records always round-trip verbatim.
- **Everything the PWA doesn't model round-trips byte-identical** (alignments sidecars, sibling
  books' files, journals from other actors). `metadata.json` is regenerated with fresh
  md5/size/scope and **role carry-forward** — the same semantics as tC4's upstream Change 1.
- **Imported `invalidated`/`status: invalid` records seed as needs-re-review**, are excluded
  from done counts (`isDone` in CheckList/report), and a fresh save clears the flag.
- **Resource pins (§5.3) are honored** for tN TSVs and tW/tA articles *and titles*
  (`vN…` version ⇒ `raw/tag/`, else `raw/branch/`).
- **Journal is the §8 DESIGN DRAFT, best-effort** — `check.decision.set` events with HLC
  timestamps (`ISO|hex4|actorId`), per-install actor id, content-hash `id`, `base` chaining;
  exported as `checking/journal/<actorId>/<BOOK>.<seq>.jsonl`. The format is not finalized
  upstream; expect churn.

Known gaps:

- **Multi-book exports update only the current book** — sibling books' decision files round-trip
  verbatim from import; states checked in a sibling PWA project are not merged in.
- **tN quote arrays use within-quote occurrence counting**, exact only when the quote occurs
  once in the verse — this tc4 path does not resolve quotes against the OL Bible. The English-gloss
  path had the same root gap but was since fixed by adopting `uw-quote-helpers` (see below); this
  path could adopt the same for exact per-word occurrences.
- **The en_ULT and UHB/UGNT used for English glosses are unpinned** (master) — §5.3 has no
  gateway-bible / original-language slot yet (`extraScripture` is not normative until tC4's first
  J2 increment).

Spec feedback owed to the tC4 team:

1. The sample-burrito's decision checkIds (`swi9`, `t1g7`, …) are fabricated — they don't exist
   in the real pinned en_tn v86 / en_twl TSVs (real TIT 1:1 tN ids: `rtc9`, `xrtm`, `tn97`,
   `fyf8`). Supports their ledger #15 (derive proof not yet run on real resources).
2. §5.3 pins have no slot for the TWL *list* repo (`en_twl`), only en_tw articles — tW check
   lists can't be pinned, undercutting "same pins ⇒ same check lists" for tW.
3. §5.2's quoteString-mismatch guidance doesn't say what a writer does with its own new
   decision (see re-anchor decision above).

## tC3 (translationCore 3) backward-compat import — `src/lib/tc3.js`

**Status: working and verified end-to-end against a real repo
(`git.door43.org/deferredreward/en_rnb_oba_book`, `tc_version 8`). Read-only import; 10 vitest
cases in `src/lib/tc3.test.js` (in `npm test`). Live archive import + in-app render confirmed:
the repo's two done tN checks (OBA 1:1 `figs-abstractnouns` → "go whup"; 1:7 `figs-aside` →
"And you Edom folks ain't got the sense to see it comin'") seed to `tn-1:1-jd1r` / `tn-1:7-rc1i`
and show as "2 of 152" completed in the report (Abstract Nouns 1/10, Aside 1/1).**

Two isolated write pipelines by design (tC3 and burrito never share a write path). This file is
the **tC3 read** side only; the tC3 write-back and the one-way tC3→burrito upgrade are spun off
as separate tasks (see gaps).

Design decisions:

- **tC3 checkData is the ancestor of tc4's decision records** — same `contextId` shape — so
  imported records are emitted tc4-shaped and the existing `seedStatesFromDecisions` (tc4.js)
  keys them unchanged (`<tool>-<ref>-<checkId>`). No new seeding path.
- **Decisions are split across per-category files** in tC3
  (`.apps/translationCore/checkData/{selections,comments,reminders,invalidated}/<book>/<ch>/<v>/<ISO>.json`);
  newest-per-category wins, then categories merge into one record per check. tC3's `text`
  (→`comments`) and `enabled` (→`reminders`) field names are bridged in tc3.js.
- **Resource pins come from the manifest, resolved _per tool_** —
  `toolsSelectedGLs[tool]` / `toolsSelectedOwners[tool]` / `tc_<gl>_check_version_<tool>` (e.g.
  `"v88_unfoldingWord"` → `v88`) — so checks fetch the exact release checked against and checkIds
  match 1:1, and a project checking tN and tW against **different gateway languages/owners**
  (a non-en org, e.g. `es-419`/`Door43-Catalog`) pins each correctly. translationAcademy follows
  the tN gateway (same owner+GL, no version — mirroring tC's own MyProjectsActions). This is the
  tC3 analog of BURRITO-SPEC §5.3.
- **`verseEdits` is deliberately excluded** (explicit `IGNORED_CATEGORIES`): it's a target-text
  edit-history audit trail, not a checking decision — the edited text is already in `<book>.usfm`
  (imported), and tC itself never counts an edit as a completed check. Importing it would fabricate
  "done" checks.
- **`format: 'tc3'` on the project** keeps tC3 fully out of the burrito write path: `syncProject`
  throws a clear "coming soon" guard, and the burrito **export** button + Door43 **sync** controls
  are hidden for tC3 in both Home and Report (so no live-looking control emits a wrong/master-pinned
  burrito). Pins ride on `project.pins` (App.loadProjectData reads it), not a burrito import
  context — so nothing tC3 touches the tc4 store.
- **Detection** (`detectProjectFormat`): a scripture-burrito `metadata.json` ⇒ burrito; else a
  tc-initialized `manifest.json` ⇒ tc3. Tolerates the DCS archive's wrapper directory.

Hardened over a 5-round Codex PR review (PR #10): per-tool resource pins (not both from tN),
a translationAcademy pin (the UI reads it), explicit `verseEdits` exclusion, and burrito
export/sync guarded + hidden for tC3. Each fix has a regression test.

Known gaps / follow-ups (spun off as suggested tasks):

- **tC3 sync-back write pipeline** — DONE (see "tC3 sync (Pipeline A write)" below): decisions
  write back to the *same* repo in tC3 format, fully separate from burrito sync.
- **tC3→Burrito upgrade** — one-way convert to burrito, either in place or to a new personal
  repo (`dcs.createRepo` + `commitFiles`); no downgrade. Would be the first real exercise of the
  authenticated DCS write path (still un-live-verified — see the DCS section).
- **Older tC3 projects without `checkId`** key only by group+quote+occurrence; those won't
  attach until re-anchored against the current resource — that fuzzy matcher is not built (the
  modern checkId path is what's verified).
- **tW/tQ:** tW imports, but its checks fetch en_twl at master (existing gap below), so a tW
  checkId may not match a pinned list; translationQuestions is not modeled and is skipped.

## tC3 sync (Pipeline A write) — `src/lib/tc3CheckData.js`, `src/lib/tc3Sync.js`

**Status: the write half of the two-isolated-pipelines design. The pure file builder
(`buildTc3CheckDataFiles`) is round-trip tested in node — 16 cases, `npm run test:tc3`, mirroring
`test:tc4`: build a decision → assert path + record shape → re-import through the tC3 READ path
(`importTc3`) and assert it seeds back to the same check id. The orchestrator (`syncTc3Project`,
pull→merge→push over DCS) is NOT live-verified — same un-verified authenticated DCS write path as
burrito sync (no credentials available); its request shapes reuse `src/lib/dcs.js` verbatim.**

When a user edits decisions on a `format: 'tc3'` project, the `⇅` button writes them back to the
*same* Door43 repo in tC3's native `.apps/translationCore/checkData/` layout — never a burrito.
Routed entirely on `project.format`: `Home.jsx`'s `sync()` calls `syncTc3Project` for tC3 and the
burrito `syncProject` otherwise; the two never share a write path (`syncProject` still throws for
tC3, `syncTc3Project` throws for non-tC3 — symmetric guards).

Design decisions:

- **Two files by the tc4.js/sync.js precedent.** `tc3CheckData.js` is the pure, node-safe builder
  (imports only `fflate` + `quoteToArray`/`normalizeQuote` from tc4.js) so the node test drives it
  directly; `tc3Sync.js` is the network/store shell (dcs, store, sync, usfmParse). `sync.js` and
  `store.js` use extensionless, browser-only imports node can't load — which is exactly why
  `test-tc4.mjs` imports only the pure `tc4.js`, never `sync.js`. Same split here.
- **Append-only write model.** Each changed decision writes a NEW timestamped file per changed
  category (`selections|comments|reminders|invalidated`) at
  `checkData/<category>/<book-lowercase>/<ch>/<v>/<ISO>.json`; filenames encode `modifiedTimestamp`
  with colons→underscores (`2026-07-08T19_29_48.018Z.json`), JSON compact — matching tC3's actual
  output (verified against the read fixture in `tc3.test.js`). Existing history is never rewritten
  or deleted. We never emit `<book>.usfm`, the chapter JSON, or the regenerable
  `.apps/translationCore/index/` groupData cache (tC desktop rebuilds it on open).
- **`contextId` is reconstructed from the pinned check definitions** (like tc4's `recordFromCheck`),
  because `seedStatesFromDecisions` drops the imported `contextId`. Faithful because the project is
  pinned to the same resource version it was checked against, so `checkId`/`quote`/`occurrence`/
  `reference` match what tC3 first wrote. tN quote → `[{word,occurrence}]` array, tW quote → the
  OrigWords string (mirrors tc4). `glQuote`/`gatewayLanguageQuote` are display caches we don't
  recompute — emitted empty; untouched remote records keep their originals (never rewritten).
- **Append-only diff = pull the remote, compare per-category against it.** `syncTc3Project` always
  downloads the archive and `importTc3`s it to get `remoteStates`, merges those into local (LWW by
  `modifiedAt`, reusing `mergeStates`/`seedStatesFromDecisions` from the burrito path), then emits a
  file only where the merged local decision differs from the remote's, per category. This is the
  tC3 analog of sync.js's "commit only changed files" and is what makes re-syncs idempotent — a
  decision already on the remote re-imports identically, so nothing is re-appended. The final git
  blob-sha diff (reused from sync.js) is a secondary guard; tC3 files are almost always fresh
  `create`s since their filenames are timestamped.
- **Filename-collision guard.** Two checks in the same verse+category sharing a `modifiedAt` would
  collide on filename; the builder bumps the millisecond (keeping a valid ISO stamp) so each gets a
  distinct file. Rare, but two seeded decisions can share an import timestamp.
- **Requires an existing `project.dcs` link.** tC3 sync writes decisions *into* the source repo
  (it never emits the manifest/USFM), so a tC3 project imported from a local `.zip` (no repo) throws
  a clear error rather than creating a malformed repo. Deliberately narrower than burrito sync's
  first-sync create-repo path.

Known gaps / follow-ups:
- **Orchestrator un-live-verified** (same as burrito sync): the pull→merge→push flow and its DCS
  writes have not run against live authenticated DCS. The pure builder + round-trip are verified.
- **Decisions on checks absent from the current pinned list are not written** (the builder iterates
  the fetched checks and skips orphan states) — the same "older tC3 without `checkId`" re-anchor
  gap noted in the read section.
- **`Report.jsx` still hides the sync control for tC3** (only `Home.jsx` was wired per this task's
  scope); enabling it there is a trivial follow-up now that `syncTc3Project` exists.

## Door43 (DCS) sync — `src/lib/dcs.js`, `src/lib/sync.js`

**Status: implemented and tested against a fake DCS (4-scenario integration test in
`sync.integration.test.js`); the unauthenticated network path verified live in-browser against
real DCS. Authenticated write (createRepo/commitFiles) and OAuth are NOT yet verified against
live DCS — no credentials/client-id were available; the request shapes are verified against
DCS's own swagger (`ChangeFilesOptions`/`ChangeFileOperation`).**

The tC3 "Upload to Door43" story rebuilt for the browser: check offline on one device, sync when
online, pick up on another. Design decisions:

- **REST, not git.** tC3 shells out to system git (`simple-git`) — impossible in a browser.
  DCS (Gitea 1.26.4+dcs) sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on `/api/v1`, archive downloads,
  and the OAuth token endpoint (verified by curl 2026-07-08), so the PWA uses pure REST like
  gateway-edit/tc-create-app: archive-zip download for reads (feeds the existing `importBurrito`,
  which already tolerates the archive's wrapper dir), batch `POST /repos/{o}/{r}/contents` for
  writes (one commit, many files; Gitea ≥1.18).
- **One sync = pull + merge + push.** Download remote archive → merge remote decisions into local
  states (LWW per §5.2 identity key by `modifiedAt`; `mergeStates`) → remote files become the new
  round-trip base → `buildBurritoFiles` (extracted from `exportBurrito`) re-merges local states on
  top → diff by locally-computed **git blob sha** (`crypto.subtle` SHA-1) → commit only changed
  files. Unlike tC3 (errors on non-fast-forward), concurrent edits on two devices converge.
  Remote-only files are never deleted. The pull also **adopts the remote source USFM** (this app
  never edits USFM in place, so remote is authoritative) so a book expanded elsewhere shows up here;
  `App.loadProjectData` re-derives the checklist after a sync so counts aren't stale.
- **Auth is optional and dual-path.** The app works fully signed-out (all resource reads stay
  unauthenticated). Sign-in: (a) OAuth PKCE public client — bible-editor's DCS OAuth design minus
  the backend; the token endpoint's CORS preflight only allows GET, so the code exchange is a
  form-encoded *simple request* (no preflight). Needs a one-time OAuth app registration on DCS
  (public client, redirect = app URL) exposed as `VITE_DCS_CLIENT_ID`. **Gitea checks "Confidential
  Client" by default when you register the app** — leave it checked and the token exchange fails
  with `invalid empty client secret` (our PKCE exchange sends no secret by design); uncheck it in
  the DCS app's Settings → Applications. Access tokens auto-refresh
  (`ensureFreshAuth`). (b) Zero-setup fallback: username+password → per-app access token
  (name qualified per device — `tcore-checks-pwa (<actorId>)` — since Gitea only reveals the secret
  at creation and can't re-read it; per-device naming means a second device's sign-in doesn't
  revoke the first's token), or an existing PAT pasted as the password (works with 2FA). Auth
  lives in IndexedDB (`dcs:auth`); the store is the source of truth — every DCS op funnels through
  `resolveAuth` (store-sourced + refresh) so a rotated OAuth token is never used stale.
- **Repo naming**: first sync prompts, default `{book}_checks`, created under the signed-in user.
  Link stored on the project (`project.dcs = {owner, repo, branch, lastSha, lastSyncAt}`);
  online imports (`fetchProjectFromDcs`) stamp the link on every book project so they sync back
  to their source repo. Multiple single-book projects pointed at one repo accumulate books.
- **The SW must not cache DCS API state** — `vite.config.js` runtimeCaching now excludes
  `/api/` and `/login/` (a stale branch head would make sync diff against an outdated tree).
- **UI keeps auth out of the way.** The account lives in a compact "Sign in" / "@username" pill
  in the header (`Door43Account.jsx`, a collapsed dropdown) — the signed-out Home is just
  USFM-upload + samples. Importing a Door43 repo appears inside "Add a translation" only when
  signed in; per-project sync is the `⇅` button on each project row and on the report screen.
  OAuth is the primary button when `VITE_DCS_CLIENT_ID` is set (mirrors bible-editor's
  "Sign in with Door43"); the password/token form is the fallback (behind a disclosure when
  OAuth is available, inline otherwise). `App.jsx` owns `auth` and runs `completeOAuth()` on load.

This section was hardened over a 5-round Codex PR review (PR #8): occurrence-collision guard in
`seedStatesFromDecisions`, `resolveAuth` (store-sourced, kills OAuth refresh-token staleness),
per-device PAT names, remote-source adoption on pull, sequenced OAuth-vs-stored auth load, and
`Report` taking `auth` as a prop so sign-out takes effect live. Regression tests cover each.

Known gaps:
- **First-sync repo-name collision.** The default repo name is `{book}_checks`, deterministic per
  book. If a repo of that name already exists under the user, `syncProject` silently adopts it —
  pulling and merging its decisions into this project. Two independent same-book projects (e.g. two
  Ruth drafts) both default to `rut_checks` and would cross-contaminate if the prompt's default is
  accepted. The rename prompt is the only guard. **Needs a confirm-before-reuse UX** ("`rut_checks`
  already exists — sync into it, or pick a new name?") on first link when the defaulted/entered repo
  already exists and is non-empty; deliberately left for a product decision rather than a silent code
  change. (`src/lib/sync.js` `syncProject`, first-sync branch.)
- No delete propagation (removing a project locally never touches DCS).
- Race between archive download and commit is unguarded (a concurrent push mid-sync could be
  overwritten for the current book's files — acceptable while one translator owns a book).
- `listMyRepos` shows all repos, not just burritos.

## English gloss of quotes — `src/lib/alignment.js`

**Status: RESOLVED. `src/lib/alignment.js` now delegates to the maintained
[`uw-quote-helpers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uw-quote-helpers) package
(`getTargetQuoteFromSourceQuote`). The hand-rolled matcher is gone from the code; the analysis
below is kept as the rationale for the switch.**

The feature shows the English (ULT) gloss of a check's original-language quote. `uw-quote-helpers`
matches the quote against the original-language book (UHB/UGNT = `sourceBook`) and pulls the aligned
words from the ULT (`targetBook`) — the same source→target model tC uses, handling word order,
per-word occurrence, verse spans and discontiguous (`&`) quotes. So `App.jsx` now fetches the OL
book alongside the ULT (`fetchOlUsfm`), and `glossQuote` is a thin wrapper.

Verified: the Obadiah 1:10 case that motivated the rework (`תְּכַסְּךָ בוּשָׁה`, where quote order ≠
verse order) now returns **"shame will cover you"** instead of nothing; OT (Ruth/UHB) and NT
(Titus/UGNT) both glossed correctly in-app. Full sweep over all 490 Ruth+Titus tN quotes:
coverage went from **350/490 (71%) → 490/490 (100%)** — every one of the 140 quotes the old matcher
returned nothing for now resolves, and sampled recoveries (discontiguous, long, word-order-flipped)
are correct.

### Why we replaced the hand-rolled version (measured evidence)

The original `glossQuote` was written from scratch (not ported). I transcribed tC's `getAlignedText`
(from `tc-ui-toolkit`) and ran it head-to-head with that version over **every tN quote
in Ruth (288) and Titus (202) = 490 quotes**, against the real ULT alignment. To compare algorithms
(not the normalization gap — see below), tC's inputs were normalized the same way `glossQuote`
normalizes, and occurrence coerced to numeric.

| | Ruth | Titus | Combined |
|---|---|---|---|
| Exact match | 148 | 103 | **251 (51%)** |
| Differ, punctuation/gap only (semantically fine) | 26 | 14 | 40 (8%) |
| Differ, **wrong/truncated words** | 43 | 16 | **59 (12%)** |
| **`glossQuote` returns nothing, tC finds text** | 71 | 69 | **140 (29%)** |

So ~59% acceptable, **~41% wrong or missing**. Examples of real failures:
- `לִשְׁתֵּי כַלֹּתֶיהָ` → tC `"to her two daughters-in-law"`, ours `"to her"` (truncated)
- `הֻגֵּד הֻגַּד` → tC `"It has been fully reported"`, ours `"fully reported"` (dropped first word)
- `כָּל־הָעִיר` → tC `"the entire town"`, ours `"entire town"` (dropped the article prefix)

### Why they diverge (from reading both line by line)

1. **Contiguity assumption (biggest cause).** `glossQuote` requires the quoted original words to be a
   *contiguous run* in alignment order, then takes that slice's English. tC instead matches **each
   word independently by content + occurrence** and assembles the English in verse order, inserting
   gap markers. Original word order ≠ English word order constantly, so our contiguous run finds only
   a fragment (truncation) or nothing (the 140 empties).
2. **Occurrence semantics.** tC matches per-word occurrence-in-verse; we ignore per-word occurrence and
   use the quote's single occurrence to pick the Nth contiguous phrase. Diverges on repeated words.
3. **Dropped punctuation.** We collect only `\w` word text and join with spaces; tC preserves the
   `type:'text'` nodes between matched words (`daughters-in-law`, `{are}`). Cosmetic but visible.
4. **Gap marker.** We emit `…` only where the quote literally contains `&`; tC emits `&` computed from
   actual verse gaps. Our gap placement is sometimes wrong.
5. **Normalization vs. quote resolution — the architectural root.** tC compares `content === word`
   with **no normalization**; on raw TSV quotes it matched **0 / 490** (the ULT `\zaln` content differs
   from the tN quote in accent order/presence). tC gets away with exact match because upstream
   `tsv-groupdata-parser` first resolves each quote against the **original-language** Bible (UHB/UGNT),
   producing exact content strings + per-word occurrences. We skipped that step and bridged it with
   fuzzy accent-stripping normalization + contiguity — which is precisely why it degrades.

Caveat on the numbers: to test, tC was fed the raw quote *string* (occurrence applied to all words),
which is not how real tC runs multi-word quotes (it uses the resolved per-word array). So true tC would
be *even better* than the "tC" column here — these numbers understate the gap.

### How it was resolved

Rather than porting `getAlignedText` by hand (and re-implementing the OL quote-resolution step it
depends on), we pulled in **`uw-quote-helpers`** — unfoldingWord's maintained, non-React library that
does exactly this (source→target quote glossing with OL matching + verse-span support). Notes on the
pull-in:
- **Not `tc-ui-toolkit`.** That package carries `getAlignedText`, but it drags in React / Material-UI /
  react-bootstrap and pins `usfm-js@^2` (we're on 3.x → peer conflict). Wrong dependency for a Preact PWA.
- `uw-quote-helpers` peer-deps `usfm-js@^3.4.2` (matches ours), adds ~13 small packages, no React,
  and bundles cleanly in Vite.
- This also let us delete the fuzzy accent-normalization + contiguity code entirely — the library
  matches against the real OL text, so no bridging hack is needed.
